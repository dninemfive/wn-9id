# WARNO 9th Infantry Division (Motorized)
Adds the 9th Infantry Division in its High Technology Light Division form as a new division in WARNO. See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fDYeJVuQjQBt5jIw4dwWt4pdex7MJqqnqmyFx7WD-Os/edit?usp=sharing) for a summary of the research used to assemble this list. 

Uses [ndf-parse](https://github.com/Ulibos/ndf-parse) to make updating less tedious. i intend to make a framework which i will pull out to make definitions even easier.

# Image Credits
- The 9th Infantry Division (HTMD) icon is based on a patch found on the cover of [*Army RD&A Magazine Jan-Feb 1983*]() and used as resources the official [9th Infantry Division shoulder patch](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:9th_Infantry_Division_patch.svg) found on Wikimedia Commons, created by Steven Williamson and placed in the public domain as a government work product, and the [Light Attack Battalion patch](https://www.fastattackvehicle.com/FAV%20Logo%20(3).jpg) found on [fastattackvehicle.com](https://www.fastattackvehicle.com).
- The icons for some units are adapted from<sup>2</sup> photographs taken by US Armed Forces members and are also government work products in the public domain, described below:

| Unit | Photographer | Source | Notes |
| ---- | ------------ | ------ | ----- |
| E-2C Hawkeye | Thomas Peterson | [Wikimedia Commons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Grumman_E-2C_Hawkeye_in_flight_DN-SD-04-13416.jpg) | |
| RQ-2 Pioneer | Daniel J. McLain | [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RQ-2B_pioneer_uav.jpg) | |
| XM-85 T-Chaparral | unknown | [Federation of American Scientists Military Analysis Network](https://man.fas.org/dod-101/sys/land/chaparral_i.htm) | i was not able to find copyright information for the colorized version which i used, but [this Wikimedia Commons page](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Towed_Chaparral.jpg) with a grayscale version of the same photograph indicates that it is a government work product, which is very likely given the trailer's prototype status. |

## Adaptations
1. The patch was adapted to look better at a low resolution by replacing the black outlines around the circle with a darker shade of green
2. Generally, images are cropped to a 2:1 ratio and resized to 320x160, usually with a selective gaussian blur filter applied.
