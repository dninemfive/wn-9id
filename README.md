# WARNO 9th Infantry Division (Motorized)
Adds the 9th Infantry Division in its High Technology Light Division form as a new division in WARNO. See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fDYeJVuQjQBt5jIw4dwWt4pdex7MJqqnqmyFx7WD-Os/edit?usp=sharing) for a summary of the research used to assemble this list. 

Uses [ndf-parse](https://github.com/Ulibos/ndf-parse) to make updating less tedious. i intend to make a framework which i will pull out to make definitions even easier.
